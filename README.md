# Void Totem

A totem that prevents you from dying in the void.

## About

Flying around in the end with your elytra and suddenly your elytra breaks? Playing SkyBlock and falling down while
building? No Problem!
Craft a Totem of Void Undying, put it in your main/-offhand and you will be teleported back to the surface, when you
fall in the void.

"A must have for skyblock and modded modpacks!"
