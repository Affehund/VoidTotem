# VoidTotem
 A mod that adds a totem that prevents you from dying in the void.

Flying around in the end with your elytra and suddenly your elytra breaks? Playing SkyBlock and falling down while building? No Problem!
Craft a Totem of Void Undying, put it in your main/-offhand and you will be teleported back to the surface or some blocks upwards, if you fall in the void.
